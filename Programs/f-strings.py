score = 0

# print("Your score is: " + score)

# you will get a TypeError (because both datatype should match)


# print("Your score is: " + str(score)) # So, we would have to convert the variable to str


# F-String

print(f"Your score is: {score}") # this will do the conversion from int to str automatically
